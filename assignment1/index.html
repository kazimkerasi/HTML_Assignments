  <h1>Hello Friends</h1>
  <p>This is my first web page & today i tell about you climate change in pakistan
    <br/> and its impact on human life
  </p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Climate Crisis</h2>
<p>
  In August 2022, torrential monsoon rains triggered the most devastating floods in Pakistan’s 
  history. Over 33 million people were affected by the floodwaters — a staggering number close 
  to the population of Canada. Our teams on the ground were quick to respond, providing close to 
  one million Pakistanis with emergency food, water, shelter, and life-saving assistance.
  
  We heard from many individuals who were impacted, including one man in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa who 
  told us, “I’ve been living in this area since birth and experienced the 2010 flood and the ones 
  before… but this one was so much more destructive because of how long the water stayed, and how 
  high it was — 8 to 15 feet tall. Entire neighborhoods are under water.”
  
  The 2022 floods, however, did not occur in a vacuum and were not an isolated event. As experts 
  have noted, the 2022 floods were made significantly worse by human-caused climate change. 
  As this report reveals, through data collected prior to the flood emergency, the region has been
   deeply affected by climate change.
  
  Pakistan produces less than 1% of the world’s carbon footprint yet is suffering the biggest 
  consequences of climate change. According to the Global Climate Risk Index, Pakistan is 
  currently the fifth most climate-vulnerable country in the world, having lost nearly ten 
  thousand lives and suffering economic losses worth 3.8 billion USD due to climate change 
  throughout the years 1999 to 2018.
  
  Changing seasonal weather patterns, rising temperatures, variability of monsoons and melting 
  of glaciers in the north — compounded with recurrent extreme weather events and natural 
  disasters — are just some of the effects of climate change that Pakistan has been forced 
  to contend with in recent years.
  
  Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK), is likewise grappling with the same effects of climate change 
  through changes in seasonal patterns and periodic natural disasters that have resulted in 
  catastrophic landslides, flash flooding and water scarcity — among other problems.</p>
  <h2>A Holistic and Effective Approach to Tackling Climate Change</h2>
  <p>Islamic Relief has been working on the ground in Pakistan for over 30 years, transforming the
     lives of millions of people. In response to the climate crisis, Islamic Relief Pakistan has 
     consistently been at the forefront of ensuring climate-adaptive approaches are mainstreamed 
     into programming. Islamic Relief recognizes that women must be at the center of the fight 
     against climate change as powerful agents of change in their communities.

    With the aim to arrive at a more detailed and practical understanding of the current and 
    long-term situation facing Pakistanis living through the climate crisis, Islamic Relief Canada 
    researchers joined Islamic Relief Pakistan on the ground, engaging in a communitybased 
    narrative inquiry study. Our researchers placed a specific emphasis on listening to women, 
    who shared their insights into the unique toll that climate change is taking on their 
    day-to-day lives.
    
    This report sheds light on the many ways that climate change is affecting communities in 
    Pakistan. We advocate for an intersectional approach to programs that tackle climate 
    change — thus, prioritizing those most impacted by creating livelihood opportunities that 
    sustain the adoption of climate-adaptive solutions.
    
    Climate change is the defining issue of our time. We are at a critical juncture where 
    governments must act immediately to avoid irreversible catastrophe. It is crucial that 
    the global community makes every effort to meet respective domestic targets and pool 
    resources to help communities that are already experiencing the crippling consequences 
    of climate change without delay.</p>
